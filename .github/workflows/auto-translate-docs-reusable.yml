            A documentation PR has been merged. Please translate any English documentation changes to Japanese and create a new PR.

            ## Task
            1. First, run `git log --oneline -10` to see recent commits.
            2. Get the original PR information using `gh pr list --state merged --limit 5` or `gh pr view <PR_NUMBER>` if PR number is provided.
            3. Identify files that were changed in the merged PR in the "docs/en-us/" directory.
            4. For each changed file, create or update the corresponding Japanese translation in "docs/ja-jp/".
            5. Maintain the same directory structure and filename in the Japanese docs.
            6. Create a new branch and pull request with the translations by using the PR template.

            ## Requirements
            - Translate all English text to natural, professional Japanese.
            - Preserve all MDX/Markdown formatting exactly (headers, lists, code blocks, links).
            - Keep code examples, URLs, and technical terms in English.
            - Ensure proper UTF-8 encoding for Japanese characters.
            - Create "docs/ja-jp/" directory structure if it doesn't exist.
            - For existing translations: Preserve unchanged content and only update sections that correspond to changes in the English version.
            - For new translations: Create complete Japanese translations of the entire document.
            - Add the following import and component AFTER the main title (# heading) and BEFORE any other content of each translated document:
              ```
              import TranslationBanner from '/src/components/_translation-ja-jp.mdx';

              <TranslationBanner />
              ```
              IMPORTANT: Place this immediately after the main title line, not before it.
            - In the front matter properties, change `displayed_sidebar: docsEnglish` to `displayed_sidebar: docsJapanese`.

            ## Process
            1. Use git to identify which files were modified in the merged PR and get the PR details.
            2. For each modified English documentation file:
               a. Check if a Japanese translation already exists in "docs/ja-jp/".
               b. If a translation exists: Use `git diff` to identify only the changed sections in the English file.
               c. If a translation exists: Update only the changed sections in the Japanese file, preserving unchanged content.
               d. If no translation exists: Create a completely new Japanese translation.
            3. Create a new branch with the format "ja-jp/<ORIGINAL_PR_BRANCH_NAME_FOR_ENGLISH_PR>", using chain case (-) to separate words.
            4. Create high-quality Japanese translations (full or partial based on changes).
            5. Save translations in docs/ja-jp/ with identical file structure.
            6. Commit the translations with a descriptive message indicating whether it's a new translation or an update.
            7. Push the branch by using: `git push origin <branch-name>`.
            8. Create a pull request by following the PR template instructions section below.

            ## PR template instructions
            When creating the pull request, follow these steps:
            1. Read the contents of `.github/pull_request_template.md` to get the base template structure.
            2. Adapt the template content for a Japanese translation PR as follows:
               - **Description:** "This PR translates the following documentation changes from English to Japanese: <LIST_FILES_WITH_CHANGE_TYPE_IN_BULLET_FORMAT>" (indicate whether each file is a new doc or updated content)
               - **Related issues and/or PRs:** Include a link to the original English PR in bullet format: "- #<ORIGINAL_PR_NUMBER>"
               - **Changes made:** List the translated files in bullet format: "- Translated English content into Japanese."
               - Keep the original checklist, but mark applicable items as completed.
            3. Add the following Claude usage note at the end of the PR body (IMPORTANT: Include the HTML image tag exactly as shown):
               ```
               > [!NOTE]
               >
               > <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81847?s=40&v=4" alt="Claude icon" height="16" style="vertical-align: middle;"> This translation was automatically generated by using Claude <MODEL_NAME> and required <TOKEN_COUNT> tokens to generate.
               ```
            4. Use `gh pr create` with title format "[Japanese] <ORIGINAL_TITLE_OF_THE_PR_IN_ENGLISH>" and the adapted template as the body. The title must follow sentence-style capitalization.

            ## Getting original PR information
            To get the original PR link and details:
            - If triggered by PR merge: Use `gh pr view ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}` or the PR URL is: `https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/pull/${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}`
            - If manually triggered with PR number: Use `gh pr view <provided_pr_number>`
            - If manually triggered without PR number: Use `gh pr list --state merged --limit 5 --json number,title,url,mergedAt` to find recent merged PRs

            ## Claude usage tracking
            When generating translations, keep track of:
            - The Claude model being used (for example, "Claude 4 Opus", "Claude 3.5 Sonnet", "Claude 3 Haiku", etc.).
            - The approximate token count used for the translation task.
            - Include this information in the GitHub-flavored admonition note.

            IMPORTANT: Make sure to authenticate with GitHub CLI first by running the gh auth commands that are available.

            Please analyze the merged PR, create the translations, and submit a new PR automatically.
