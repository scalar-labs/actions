# Set Up Workflow for Checking PR Project Assignments

The [`.github/workflows/pr-project-assignment-check-reusable.yaml`](../.github/workflows/pr-project-assignment-check-reusable.yaml) workflow checks if a PR has a project assigned in the GitHub sidebar. The following outcomes are possible when the workflow runs:

- **If projects are assigned:** The workflow detects the assigned project(s) and completes without posting a PR comment.
- **If no projects are assigned:** The workflow posts a PR comment mentioning the PR creator (@username) as a heads-up.
  - The workflow also shows a warning annotation (non-blocking) if no projects are found. The reason why this is a warning and not an error is to allow flexibility in cases where project assignment may not be mandatory.

> [!NOTE]
>
> **Backport PRs are automatically excluded:** The workflow will not run at all for backport PRs, avoiding any GitHub Actions costs. A backport PR is identified by a title that starts with "Backport to branch" and includes a branch format like `MAJOR.MINOR-pull-PR_NUMBER` in either the PR title or the branch name (for example, "Backport to branch 3.17-pull-1234" or branch "3.17-pull-1234"). This filtering happens at the workflow trigger level for zero-cost exclusion.

## Requirements

- The repository must have GitHub Projects enabled.
- Workflow requires `contents: read`, `issues: write`, and `pull-requests: write` permissions.

### Private project support

> [!NOTE]
>
> The following steps are for reference since we use the existing PAT `GH_PR_PAT` for this workflow. Because of that PAT is managed at an organizational level, it can be used across all our repositories that we want to use this workflow in.

To detect **private projects**, you'll need to provide a Personal Access Token (PAT) with the `read:project` scope:

1. **Create a PAT:** Go to [GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. **Add the `read:project` scope:** This enables access to private projects.
3. **Add as repository secret:** Store the token as `GH_PR_PAT` in your repository secrets.

> [!WARNING]
>
> Without this PAT, only public projects will be detected. Private projects will be ignored, and the workflow will only return public projects assigned to the PR.

## Implement the workflow

Copy the [`pr-project-assignment-check.yaml`](./pr-project-assignment-check.yaml) file to your repository's `.github/workflows/` directory to automatically check project assignments when PRs are opened.
