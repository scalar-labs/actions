## With a large pull request body (64KiB)
# NOTE:
# The Java Process class has a limited buffer size for input and output
# streams (typically 64KB). If the buffer reaches its limit, the process
# becomes blocked until space is freed by reading from or writing to the
# streams. The current implementation of the release note script uses
# Process to execute the gh command for GitHub operations. However, some
# pull requests created by Dependabot occasionally exceed this limit
# (over 64KB in the body). To prevent blocking, the script has been
# modified accordingly. I added this test case to verify that the script
# functions correctly with large PRs.
