# Release Note Script

These are scripts for generating the main body of release notes for Scalar products. There are two scripts available:

- ReleaseNoteCreation.java ... Creates a release note body for a target repository.
- MergeReleaseNotes.java ... Creates a merged release note body for ScalarDB (including community and enterprise edition).

These scripts are invoked in GitHub Actions workflows when releasing a new version of Scalar products. 

For the details of the release note please see [General rules]().

## Prerequisites

- [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/)
- Java 11+

## How to Run the Scripts

Note that primarily, these scripts are intended to be executed within GitHub Actions workflows.
So usually you don't need to execute the scripts manually.

### Create a Release Note Body for Each Repository

*Assuming the use of Java 11*
To run the script:

```shell
java --source 11 ReleaseNoteCreation.java <owner> <projectTitlePrefix> <version> <repository>
```

Here, the arguments mean the following:

- *owner*: Owner of the target repository.
- *projectTitlePrefix*: Prefix for the target version project.
  - e.g., If the project name of the target is `ScalarDB 4.0.0`, then specify `ScalarDB`. 
- *version*: The target version to create the release note.
  - e.g., If the project name of the target is `ScalarDB 4.0.0`, then specify `4.0.0`. 
- *repository*: The name of the target repository.

Example: To create the release note for ScalarDB 4.0.0

```shell
java --source 11 ReleaseNoteCreation.java scalar-labs ScalarDB 4.0.0 scalardb
```

The result will be output in markdown format to the standard output.

### Create a Merged Release Note for ScalarDB

*Assuming the use of Java 11*

Before running this script, make sure you have the release note bodies for ScalarDB, ScalarDB Cluster, ScalarDB GraphQL, and ScalarDB SQL as markdown files in the current directory.

To run the script:

```shell
java --source 11 MergeReleaseNotes.java scalardb.md cluster.md graphql.md sql.md
```

The result will be output in markdown format to the standard output.
